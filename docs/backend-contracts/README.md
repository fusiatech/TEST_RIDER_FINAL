# Backend API Contracts

This folder documents backend-only contracts for:

- Profile and integration ownership by `userId`
- Billing and entitlements lifecycle
- Integration lifecycle endpoints (GitHub/Figma/MCP/Slack/Linear)
- Provider catalog and model discovery
- API inventory and OpenAPI drift reporting

See `reports/api-inventory.md` for generated inventory results.
See `BACKEND_ISOLATION.md` for enforced backend-only boundaries.
See `UIUX_BACKEND_HANDOFF_v1.md` for the separate UI/UX contract package (no wiring).
